Super Reduced String
----------

Reduce a string of lowercase characters in range ascii[‘a’..’z’]by doing a series of operations. In each operation, select a pair of adjacent letters that match, and delete them.

Delete as many characters as possible using this method and return the resulting string. If the final string is empty, return Empty String.

Example
--------
Input  = "aab"

Output = "b" -> aa is removed

Sample INPUT and OUTPUT
------------------------
Input                                            Output

aaabccddd                       -                 abd

My Solution
-------------

public static String superReducedString(String s) {
    StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder(s);

    for(int i = 0; i<str.length()-1; i++){
        Character c1 = str.charAt(i);
        Character c2 = str.charAt(i+1);
        if(c1.equals(c2)){
            str.deleteCharAt(i);
            str.deleteCharAt(i);
            i = -1;
        }
    }

    return str.length() == 0 ? "Empty String" : str.toString();
}
