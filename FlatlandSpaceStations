Problem
----------

Flatland is a country with a number of cities, some of which have space stations. Cities are numbered consecutively and each has a road of 1km length connecting it to the next city. 
It is not a circular route, so the first city doesn't connect with the last city. Determine the maximum distance from any city to its nearest space station.

Example
--------
Input  = n = 3, c = [1]

Output = 1 => There are n=3 cities and city 1 has a space station. They occur consecutively along a route. City 0 is 1-0 = 1 unit away and city 2 is 2-1 = 1 units away.
              City 1 is 0 units from its nearest space station as one is located there. The maximum distance is 1.

Sample INPUT and OUTPUT
------------------------
Input                                            Output

 n = 5, c = [0, 4]                       -         2

My Solution
-------------

public static int flatlandSpaceStations(int n, int[] c) {
    List<Integer> integerList = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Integer> resultList = new ArrayList<>();

    for(int val : c){
        integerList.add(val);
    }

    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        if(!integerList.contains(i)){
            List<Integer> tempList = new ArrayList<>();
            int finalI = i;
            integerList.forEach(x -> {
                tempList.add(Math.abs(x - finalI));
            });
            resultList.add(Collections.min(tempList));
        }
    }

    return resultList.size() !=0 ? Collections.max(resultList) : 0;
}
